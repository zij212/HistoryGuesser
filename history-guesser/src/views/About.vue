        History Guesser is an educational game where you are matched with a random figure from history.

        The goal is to figure out who it is by talking to them.  Maybe it is Leonardo da Vinci.. or Genghis Kahn.

        You have a limited amount of questions you can ask, and will only get limited information back -- so choose wisely!

      <p class="title">How it works</p>
      <p class="subtitle">
        Since you can't actually speak to the real people, we are using OpenAI's davince AI to act like random historical figures.
        Behind the scenes, The AI is instructed to be a random person.  And then a conversation can be had!
